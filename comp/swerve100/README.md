# Swerve 100

This is the main comp bot repo.

Part of the code here was (somewhat distantly) derived from 254 code, and other parts were inspired by Roadrunner.

# Getting Started

First time working on Control? Fret not! This guide will walk you through everything from setting up your development environment, to deploying code to the RoboRIO, to controlling your first motor, and then to building a complex robot. It's an in-progress guide so please add to it anytime you see gaps.

Chapters:
1. [Setting up your development environment](README_1_STARTING.md)
2. [Getting your first motor running](README_2_MOTOR.md)
